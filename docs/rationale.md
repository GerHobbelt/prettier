Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. This document explains some of its choices.

## What Prettier is concerned about

### Correctness

The first requirement of Prettier is to output valid code that has the exact same behavior as before formatting. Please report any code where Prettier fails to follow these correctness rules ‚Äî that's a bug which needs to be fixed!

### Strings

Double or single quotes? Prettier chooses the one which results in the fewest number of escapes. `"It's gettin' better!"`, not `'It\'s gettin\' better!'`. In case of a tie, Prettier defaults to double quotes (but that can be changed via the [`--single-quote`](options.html#quotes) option).

JSX always uses double quotes. JSX takes its roots from HTML, where the dominant use of quotes for attributes is double quotes. Browser developer tools also follow this convention by always displaying HTML with double quotes, even if the source code uses single quotes.

Prettier maintains the way your string is escaped. For example, `"üôÇ"` won't be formatted into `"\uD83D\uDE42"` and vice versa.

### Empty lines

It turns out that empty lines are very hard to automatically generate. The approach that Prettier takes is to preserve empty lines the way they were in the original source code. There are two additional rules:

- Prettier collapses multiple blank lines into a single blank line.
- Empty lines at the start and end of blocks (and whole files) are removed. (Files always end with a single newline, though.)

### Multi-line objects

By default, Prettier‚Äôs printing algorithm prints expressions on a single line if they fit. Objects are used for a lot of different things in JavaScript, though, and sometimes it really helps readability if they stay multiline. See [object lists], [nested configs], [stylesheets] and [keyed methods], for example. We haven't been able to find a good rule for all those cases, so Prettier instead keeps objects multiline if there's a newline anywhere inside it in the original source code. A consequence of this is that long singleline objects are automatically expanded, but short multiline objects are never collapsed.

### Semicolons

This is about using the [`--no-semi`](options.md#semicolons) option.

Consider this piece of code:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
if (shouldAddLines) {
  [-1, 1].forEach(delta => addLine(delta * 20))
}
```

While the above code works just fine without semicolons, Prettier actually turns it into:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
if (shouldAddLines) {
  ;[-1, 1].forEach(delta => addLine(delta * 20))
}
```

This is to help you avoid mistakes. Imagine Prettier _not_ inserting that semicolon and adding this line:

```diff
 if (shouldAddLines) {
+  console.log('Do we even get here??')
   [-1, 1].forEach(delta => addLine(delta * 20))
 }
```

Oops! The above actually means:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
if (shouldAddLines) {
  console.log('Do we even get here??')[-1, 1].forEach(delta => addLine(delta * 20))
}
```

With a semicolon in front of that `[` such issues never happen. It makes the line independent of other lines so you can move and add lines without having to think about ASI rules.

This practice is also common in [standard] which uses a semicolon-free style.

### Print width

The [`--print-width`](options.md#print-width) is more of a guideline to Prettier than a hard rule. It generally means ‚Äútry to make lines this long, go shorter if needed and longer in special cases.‚Äù

There are some edge cases, such as really long string literals, regexps, comments and variable names, which cannot be broken across lines (without using code transforms which [Prettier doesn‚Äôt do](#what-prettier-is-not-concerned-about)). Or if you nest your code 50 levels deep your lines are of course going to be mostly indentation :)

Apart from that, there are a few cases where Prettier intentionally exceeds the print width.

#### Imports

Prettier can break long `import` statements across several lines:

```js
import {
  CollectionDashboard,
  DashboardPlaceholder
} from "../components/collections/collection-dashboard/main";
```

The following example doesn't fit within the print width, but Prettier prints it in a single line anyway:

```js
import { CollectionDashboard } from "../components/collections/collection-dashboard/main";
```

This might be unexpected by some, but we do it this way since it was a common request to keep `import`s with single elements in a single line. The same applies for `require` calls.

#### Testing functions

Another common request was to keep lengthy test descriptions in one line, even if it gets too long. In such cases, wrapping the arguments to new lines doesn‚Äôt help much.

```js
describe("NodeRegistry", () => {
  it("makes no request if there are no nodes to prefetch, even if the cache is stale", async () => {
    // The above line exceeds the print width but stayed on one line anyway.
  });
});
```

Prettier special cases common test framework functions such as `describe`, `it` and `test`.

### JSX

Prettier prints things a little differently compared to other JS when JSX is involved:

```jsx
function greet(user) {
  return user
    ? `Welcome back, ${user.name}!`
    : "Greetings, traveler! Sign up today!";
}

function Greet({ user }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {user ? (
        <p>Welcome back, {user.name}!</p>
      ) : (
        <p>Greetings, traveler! Sign up today!</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

There are two reasons.

First off, lots of people already wrapped their JSX in parentheses, especially in `return` statements. Prettier follows this common style.

Secondly, [the alternate formatting makes it easier to edit the JSX](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/2208). It is easy to leave a semicolon behind. As opposed to normal JS, a leftover semicolon in JSX can end up as plain text showing on your page.

```jsx
<div>
  <p>Greetings, traveler! Sign up today!</p>; {/* <-- Oops! */}
</div>
```

### Comments

When it comes to the _contents_ of comments, Prettier can‚Äôt do much really. Comments can contain everything from prose to commented out code and ASCII diagrams. Since they can contain anything, Prettier can‚Äôt know how to format or wrap them. So they are left as-is. The only exception to this are JSDoc-style comments (block comments where every line starts with a `*`), which Prettier can fix the indentation of.

Then there‚Äôs the question of _where_ to put the comments. Turns out this is a really difficult problem. Prettier tries it best to keep your comments roughly where they where, but it‚Äôs no easy task because comments can be placed almost anywhere.

Generally, you get the best results when placing comments **on their own lines,** instead of at the end of lines. Prefer `// eslint-disable-next-line` over `// eslint-disable-line`.

Note that ‚Äúmagic comments‚Äù such as `eslint-disable-next-line` and `$FlowFixMe` might sometimes need to be manually moved due to Prettier breaking an expression into multiple lines.

Imagine this piece of code:

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line no-eval
const result = safeToEval ? eval(input) : fallback(input);
```

Then you need to add another condition:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// eslint-disable-next-line no-eval
const result = safeToEval && settings.allowNativeEval ? eval(input) : fallback(input);
```

Prettier will turn the above into:

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line no-eval
const result =
  safeToEval && settings.allowNativeEval ? eval(input) : fallback(input);
```

Which means that the `eslint-disable` comment is no longer effective. In this case you need to move the comment:

```js
const result =
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-eval
  safeToEval && settings.allowNativeEval ? eval(input) : fallback(input);
```

## What Prettier is _not_ concerned about

Prettier only _prints_ code. It does not transform it. This is to limit the scope of Prettier. Let's focus on the printing and do it really well!

Here are a few examples of things that are out of scope for Prettier:

- Turning single- or double-quoted strings into template literals or vice versa.
- Using `+` to break long string literals into parts that fit the print width.
- Adding/removing `{}` and `return` where they are optional.
- Turning `?:` into `if`-`else` statements.
- Sorting and hoisting `import`s. (Sorting is unsafe because of side effects, which would violate the [correctness](#correctness) goal.)
